# Whether-app

This is my semester project of Web technologies. 
I have created a weather app using MERN stack. 
For weather data I have used weather stack api.
There are total of 5 pages:
1. Home page (display the current weather + can search any place weather + a bot)
2. Saved (Saved locations)
3. About us page
4. Sign in page
5. Register page

Here is the link of website: https://whether-guider.herokuapp.com/
